ARRAY : this is a linear data structure which holds the homogeneous data (same type of data), we can access its elements through indices..

It is access through arr[8] or arr[0] (through indices only).

Array is of 3 types:

best way to access values from arrays is loop, bcz when we have to perform repeated tasks, we use loops.

length method will always count and starts from 1 not 0., but index always starts with 0.

for each loop will use when we have to print the indexes and value .. In java we will write only for, not each!! but in other languages, we will write for and each separately,

SYNTAX :  

FOR(INT NUM:MARKS){
    SOUT(NUM);
}

FOR EACH LOOP WILL PRINT ONLY VALUES... NOT FULL ARRAY!

2. 2D : arr[i][j] : rows and cols
3. two loops : inner and outer ; outer[i] rows will modify the rows and inner[j] cols will perform the inner operations..

1D Array : it is also known as vector array in some languages..
2D Array 
Multi Dimensional Array
